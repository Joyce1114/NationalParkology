Tropical Wet,"Temperatures stay the same throughout most of the year because these areas are found along the equator and receive constant direct sunlight.  The average temperature is about 80 degrees (27 Celsius) as you can see from the line below.  The temperatures feel hotter because the humidity is usually very high.  Humidity is the amount of water in the air.  Daytime temperatures rarely go over 93 degrees, and nighttime temperatures rarely go below 68 degrees. "
Tropical Wet and Dry,"During the wet season, temperatures average about 77 degrees.  During the dry season, temperatures average about 68 degrees.  The temperatures stay high throughout the year because of the latitude where this climate occurs.  Areas near the equator receive constant direct sunlight and therefore, heat.   The slight difference in temperature is enough to change the wind patterns and keep this area dry for much of the year, until the winds shift and the rainy season begins.  '),"
Humid Subtropical,"a type of terrain with little to no vegetation. This is normally because it also has very little water, although other factors, such as poisoning with salt and similar substances, or just extreme exhaustion of the soil may also be a factor.Although deserts are generally thought of as hot places, many are not - the Gobi and similar deserts (including those in the Artic and Antartic) are famously chilly places and the Bledow Desert in Poland manages to exist in a temperate region. Although heat often does play a major part in the existence of a desert, and area can dry out just as easily because its ''rainfall'' rarely, if ever, melts or just because it is in the rainshadow of a mountain range and receives little or no rain in the first place.'),"
Continental Humid,"A forest will tend to be sparsely settled compared to agricultural land (since, if it were not sparsely settled, the trees would have been felled and the land turned over to agriculture), but may still contain villages and towns, let alone smaller habitations.A forest may - or may not - be managed by a forester of one kind or another."
Mediterranean,"The climate is known for warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. Winter temperatures are usually between 30 and 65 degrees.  Summer months all average above 50 degrees.  The warmest month averages about 72 degrees.  The cause of this climate is directly related to large bodies of water such as the Mediterranean Sea and ocean currents.  During the summer, cold currents keep the climate mild and dry.  Ocean currents shift as the seasons change. During the winter the water that was warmed up all summer moves in and keeps the land warm and often brings rain.  '),"
Tundra,"Winters are very harsh in Tundra climate.  Winter months temperatures are usually between -18 and -50 degrees.  ""Summer"" temperatures range from 35-50 degrees.  High latitudes are the main cause of of the low temperatures.  These areas mainly receive indirect sunlight.  Indirect sunlight delivers light, but little heat.  Even during the summer, Tundra mainly receives indirect sunlight, which is why temperatures rarely go above 50 degrees.  '),"
Ice Cap,"Ice Cap is the coldest climate on Earth.  Antarctica is usually colder than the Arctic.  The ""warmest"" month averages about -16  degrees.  The coldest month averages about -70 degrees.  During the winter, temperatures regularly reach -90 degrees. The coldest temperature ever recorded was -128.6 degrees.  Ice Cap temperatures are so low because of its latitude near the poles.  These areas receive only indirect sunlight, and during winter it doesn''t even receive indirect sunlight!   During the winter this area is in total darkness (see image above). "
Desert,"Temperatures can reach as high as 130 degrees or as low as negative 30 degrees.  The temperatures will depend on the latitude of the desert.  The farther from the equator the colder they will be.  On the map above you can see areas of cold desert (light red) and hot desert (dark red), and distance from the equator is clearly the cause.  '),"
Semiarid,"The temperatures in Semiarid climate depend on the latitude.  They will follow the same temperature patterns as the surrounding area.  For example in northern United States the Semiarid climate can be very cold, especially during winter.  Temperatures can be as low as -15 degrees.  However, it the African Sahel or northern Australia, temperatures remain high throughout the year, so latitude is clearly the cause of temperature in Semiarid climate. ')"
Arid,"Temperatures can reach as high as 130 degrees or as low as negative 30 degrees.  The temperatures will depend on the latitude of the desert.  The farther from the equator the colder they will be.  On the map above you can see areas of cold desert (light red) and hot desert (dark red), and distance from the equator is clearly the cause.
