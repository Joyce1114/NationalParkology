Cave/Crevice,"Natural opening within a rock formation which is large enough to permit a human to enter.A fracture is any separation in a geologic formation, such as a joint ora fault that divides the rock into two or more pieces. A fracture will sometimes form a deep fissure or crevice in the rock. Fractures are commonly caused by stress exceeding the rock strength, causing the rock to lose cohesion along its weakest plane."
Desert,"a type of terrain with little to no vegetation. This is normally because it also has very little water, although other factors, such as poisoning with salt and similar substances, or just extreme exhaustion of the soil may also be a factor.Although deserts are generally thought of as hot places, many are not - the Gobi and similar deserts (including those in the Artic and Antartic) are famously chilly places and the Bledow Desert in Poland manages to exist in a temperate region. Although heat often does play a major part in the existence of a desert, and area can dry out just as easily because its ''rainfall'' rarely, if ever, melts or just because it is in the rainshadow of a mountain range and receives little or no rain in the first place.'),"
Forest,"A forest will tend to be sparsely settled compared to agricultural land (since, if it were not sparsely settled, the trees would have been felled and the land turned over to agriculture), but may still contain villages and towns, let alone smaller habitations.A forest may - or may not - be managed by a forester of one kind or another."
Glacier,"Glaciers are large masses of persistent ice (surviving over a time scale of many years). Glaciers are primarily found in the Antarctic, Greenland, certain other parts of the high Arctic, and high mountains.Glaciers flow, rather like rivers or lava flows, though much slower - a ''fast'' glacier may move a couple of meters per day (though the Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland moves up to 20 meters a day). Fast-moving glaciers can even produce ''glacial earthquakes'', and the frequency of these quakes appears to be increasing „ possibly due to climate change?"
Lake,"Lakes are usually very important to the societies that live around them, serving as a source of food, water and transport - the Sea of Galilee3 - should be familiar to us all, as should the Dead Sea (actually a salt lake) which despite being dead (as the name implies) serves as a salt mine for the whole region.'),"

Mountain,"A monadnock, inselberg or kopje is a short but steep mountain rising out of lower or flatter terrain. Geologically, they are formed when a harder, erosion-resistant rock is surrounded by softer more readily eroded rock. After many years of weathering, the hard rock remains tall and unaffected, while the softer materials have worn far away. The resulting terrain is a steep cliff-face a little like a plateau, often adorned with vegetation on the top.In arid or over-farmed environments, it''s quite common for a monadnock to be a refuge for wildlife. The high rock retains topsoil and thick vegetation, where the lower more heavily traveled and eroded lands are barren in comparison. Steep cliffs at the edges of the monadnock serve to isolate the local lifeforms."

Swamp,"A swamp is a region that mixes solid land with shallow bodies of water. The water is very slow moving, and covered by abundant vegetation which in some cases may be hard to distinguish from solid land merely by looking at it, thus making movement very difficult without (flat) boats The animals living in a swamp are likely to be abundant and diverse, and usually swamps are plagued by stinging insects such as mosquitoes. Leeches are also common in most freshwater swamps.Swamps can occur in any suitable climate - large areas of tundra become swamp during the summer thaw - and can vary in vegetative cover from little but tussock grass (as found in many peat bogs) to a thick, jungle like tree cover.')"
